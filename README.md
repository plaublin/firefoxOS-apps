html5-snake
===========

HTML5 version of the classic Snake game, for Firefox OS


Todo
====

* There is a problem with the direction: the game does not always get the right direction, especially around the sides.

* We would like to add ennemies: a mongoose that would kill the snake if it eats it.

* Add a special screen in case of a game over

* Make it a Firefox OS application
